                    <h2>The dangers of social media tools</h2>
                    <p>As with anything asociated wiith the internet there are dangers to be aware of when using social media tools:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Some social media tools may require personal information which can be accesed if you are not careful about keeping your accounts secure.</li>
                        <li>To keep your accounts secure you should avoid using the same password for each account as if someone could access one they could acccess the others.</li>
                        <li>If you were to stop using any social media tool, you should make sure that you delete the account afterwards as if you don't people could still hack into it and you would not even know.</li>
                        <li>Change your password regularly.</li>
                    </ol>
                        
                        <p>There are also other dangers that you should be aware of before using social media tools, such as when ever you say anything on a social media tool, it can't be undone.You can delete it on your phone yes but it won't stop the person or people that you said it to from seeing it. Also for some social media tools, they gather up information that you may have mentioned or said and can sell it on to advertisement companies that can send you targeted ads, this is just something that you should be aware of.</p>
