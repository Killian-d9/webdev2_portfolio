                <h2>Instagram</h2>
                    <p>At most, Instagram is a social networking app which allows the user to share pictures, videos with friends and to message people dirctly. It can be downloaded for free from the App store or Play store. It was founded in 2012 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger who were both Stanford University graduates, then in 2010 Facebook bought the company and have ran it ever since.</p>
                <h2>Uses for college</h2>
                    <p>For anyone wondering how such a social media tool such as Instagram could be used for college students and lecturers here is how:</p>
                <ol>
                        <li>Direct messages: Direct messages or DMs allow a person to message one person directly or up to 15 people. While being able to message people in direct messages, you can also send pictures which could be used to send examples or work, key points on a brief or even  video explanation if there was any misunderstanding involving an assignment.</li>
                        <li>If someone didn't wish to DM someone and rather send a piece of information to a mass of people they can post it, allowing all they followers(people who you have added and can view your posts and you can message) to view it, this may come in handy if you wished to put up a brief of an assignment for stuents to see</li>
                        <li>Another feature availabe on Instagram are Instagram stories, which allows the user to post videos/photos into one story. This story can be viewed by who ever the user wishes, for example if they have a private account this means that people can only look at their story if they are following the user already.</li>
                </ol>
